## Details

- Approx. completion time: **2 hours**
- Deliverables: **1 HTML file, 1 CSS file, images**

Using only typography and box model CSS properties, complete the layout to match the one presented in the mockups.

*Inside your CSS file, these are the only properties you can use:*

- `background-color`
- `border`
- `box-sizing`
- `color`
- `display`
- `font` (`font-family`, `font-size`, `font-style`, `line-height`)
- `list-style-type`
- `margin`
- `padding`
- `text-align`
- `text-decoration`
- `width`

*If the property isn’t on the list you just don’t need it.*
